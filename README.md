## Overview
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. For organizations overflowing with data but struggling to turn it into useful insights, machine learning can provide the solution to analyze and make data-driven recommendations and decisions. Businesses use machine learning to recognize patterns and then make predictions about what will appeal to customers, improve operations, or help make a product better. 

Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML. It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.

##### Why use Random Forest?
Below are some points that explain why we should use the Random Forest algorithm:
1) It takes less training time as compared to other algorithms.
2) It predicts output with high accuracy, even for the large dataset it runs efficiently.
3) It can also maintain accuracy when a large proportion of data is missing.

## Summary
The aim of the project is to answer the below research questions:
a) Does price vary with Airlines?
b) How is the price affected when tickets are bought in just 1 or 2 days before departure?
c) Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?
d) How the price changes with change in Source and Destination?
e) How does the ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?
## Tools
The tools are Python as programming language and libraries used are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. And Scikit-learn for implementing Machine Learning algorithms.
## Dataset
The dataset is using dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction).
